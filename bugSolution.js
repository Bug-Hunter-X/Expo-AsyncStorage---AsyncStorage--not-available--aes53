The solution often involves verifying that AsyncStorage is correctly configured for the target environment.  If problems persist, consider using an alternative storage solution like MMKV for better compatibility and performance.  Here's an example of using MMKV:

```javascript
import * as MMKVStorage from 'react-native-mmkv-storage';

const storage = new MMKVStorage.Loader().initialize();

// ... use storage.setItem, storage.getItem, etc. ...
```
Remember to install `react-native-mmkv-storage`.

If the issue is only on iOS simulator, it could be because the simulator doesn't provide a proper environment for AsyncStorage. If so, using a physical device or an emulator that is more aligned with the actual environments is the optimal solution.
